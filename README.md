# ta - calendar
An app to plan your day, _every minute of your day_. Have you ever felt the day is about to over and you haven't even started on the first thing to do? 
  
##Motivation
_"One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare."_ - [Cal Newport](http://calnewport.com/). 
  
[Deep work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work) is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It’s a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. It's like a superpower in our increasingly competitive twenty-first-century economy.  
  
One way to achieve deep work is to spend time only on things that matter. We spend much of our day on autopilot mode. To avoid this, we have to drain the shallows, we have to take control of our time, we have to _schedule every minute of the day_. We must prioritize ruthlessly, and strike out everything that isn't worth the time.
  
This app helps you to achieve exactly that. It allows you to plan your day in intervals of 30 minutes. There is small to-do list widget on the right side which is to dump everything else that comes in-between. The idea is to focus only on one and one thing at a time - what are we doing today.

##Why not any other todo list?
Most of the to-do lists help you list down things you want to do without considering the most important factor - how long will it take? And within a couple of days, that list becomes wishlist of things we want to achieve (sometime in future). ta - calendar helps by considering that task duration. Whenever you plan task you have to specify when you will do and how long it will take, this way your today's list does not become a dump of things to do.

Of course, the idea is not to keep working for 9 hours a day deeply. But to keep track of your own time. You can (and should) always add entries like `Lunch`, `Foosball game`, etc to keep list concise.

##What does ta - calendar mean?
It's just a word I came up with. Probably a mixture of `task list`, `todo list`, and `calendar`.

##Technology
This app is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and everything is stored in browser's `localStorage`. There is no server. The app, tasks, everything lives in your browser. So don't worry about privacy and other stuff. It uses GA to gather some fun stats.
